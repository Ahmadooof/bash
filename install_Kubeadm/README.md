## This script used to install cluster using kubeadm
I have used Linux, ubuntu server 22.04, adm64 processor arch,
It could fail if you install it with different architecture processor.
Run the script from 1-12, do not jump between numbers, if you got error in a step, then do not contine, to the next one.
